    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="A1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Coast Guard’s new Career Competency Tool (CCT), is a simple on-line tool enabling every Coast Guard member to see where they are in the organization and what is broadly required for every other job they may be interested in in any career stream, level, and location. There will be related portals for external candidates and students potentially interested in joining the Coast Guard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some specificities are absent (e.g. ship classes/sea time) we paid attention to the details of the work Coast Guard members do while seeking commonalities. The idea of career columns as lists of minimal level competencies, and comparisons to others, is new; but the language is designed for Coast Guard members. This tool will be unique not merely to the Coast Guard but to the entire public service.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;These refer to the behaviours or attitudes deemed important in those carrying out work in the Coast Guard. We used the first four and their associated definitions and levels directly from Treasury Board and added three more at the behest of Coast Guard senior management.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A11" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The ratings are the result of a series of preparatory discussions, and drafted with knowledge that there could be changes during and following consultations. Where possible we also used posters and existing program competency dictionaries which may have featured ratings and definitions. We conducted relativity exercises to ensure levels are commensurate with pay across classifications. In some cases a specific competency and its ratings will straddle more than one classification. Bear in mind that requests to change competency levels may result in negative consequences elsewhere in the tool, since many competencies are linked.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A12" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Some positions have certain specific technical competencies and also feature more generic ones. We separated different positions of the same classification and level where the work of those positions differs from other positions. Each contains specific and common competencies; each career ‘column’ represents the minimum competencies and ratings for that position.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A13" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A ship’s crewing profile is a published list of minimum requirements (certification, experience, training) – independent of individual crew members’ needs – deemed required for a ship to sail. The CCT addresses the career developmental needs of those individual crew members’ and those of all Coast Guard members.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A14" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A training competency profile is a specific list of formal and experiential training objectives deemed necessary for successful completion of a program or course within a Coast Guard operational program. The CCT competencies are broader in order to encompass commonalities. For example, the CCT “Acts and Regulations” competency indicates that there is a necessity to master acts and regulations pertaining to a given career column; but what they are is for individual Coast Guard programs to flesh out. Training competencies and objectives may stem from competency profiles in the CCT.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A15" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;We inventoried and used all existing competency profiles. The formats differ but as a baseline most of the material in your previously created profile exists in ours and more.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A16" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;We created these competencies by looking at posters and existing competency dictionaries. We can revise. Bear in mind that requests for change to a competency may not always be possible in part because they would create unwanted impacts elsewhere in the tool, since many competencies are linked.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A17" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Positions are constantly being renamed as the Coast Guard undergoes changes, so if you don’t see your position, look under your classification and level and you will likely find its function with a slightly different name. If it is wholly missing, we will add it.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A18" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The implementation of this competency framework will not jeopardize anyone’s job. This is meant as a tool for career progression and professional development guidance, and is unrelated to performance management, pay, or classification.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A19" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The ratings a manager assigns a given employee are distinct from the scoring in the competency profiles. The former are scores based on an individual’s actual performance in a position; the latter define the minimum value of that position within the whole organization. Our definitions seek to provide indicators of that value organizationally, as derived where possible from TBS job or classification evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During our Force Generation consultations we discovered that there was a national appetite for this kind of work because of its potential to empower Coast Guard members in their own career development. Had we done project-specific pre-consultations, however, the time, cost, and disparities would have made it difficult to map a common tool effectively and efficiently. Little in the profiles and tool has been made up by the team; it is based on posted material and subsequent feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the CCT was never constructed and the work ended with the competency profiles and consultations, every position and classification will be mapped and described using all available tools and indicators. From here the information may be used for staffing (e.g. SoMCs), training, and career development, including the development of professional development programs, which are proven recruiting and training programs.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A20" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You can find pay rates of each position on the Treasury Board of Canada website &lt;a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/hrpubs/coll_agre/rates-taux-eng.asp" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;For every classification and level we used every job poster we could locate for several years back to ensure that we were using the right material. We inventoried and used existing competency profiles. Where available we used TBS job/classification evaluations for jobs. Unions were notified of the work and invited to comment. We had a post construction consultation to iron out differences while highlighting the value of similarities and the logic of selection. This beta test will comprise a final layer of consultation to ensure that we have got it right, and even afterwards we will always be able to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A project of this size would be costly and lengthy. Previous attempts to review competencies at the Coast Guard by external consultants have resulted in inconsistencies in form and content between programs. However, some of that work has been used here as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a team, we had varied experiences in competency work and related areas. Our goal was to shepherd existing material into a single template to create a tool of use to all Coast Guard members for career development, training, and staffing needs. We have received some feedback on our efforts from competency consultants and have taken that feedback into account, too.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;We did not because these job descriptions don’t exist for all positions. Many that do exist appear to be out of date; and of these, there further appears to be a discrepancy between what they specify and what is being posted online.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;We inventoried all existing job posters going back several years; in other words, for the most part the program managers picked the competencies for us.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The statements of merit criteria posted online generally follow factors such as need, experience, and organizational change, which are reflected where possible in the CCT. We noted that over time there were some significant commonalities. Where possible we also used job/classification evaluations, which feature great permanency.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Certification competencies are certifications necessary to do a given job. As competencies they represent the successful completion of a course or courses of approved training and/or education at a recognized institution. In the CCT, we acknowledged and tried to mark where some certifications in the same classification and levels may vary and may change.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="A9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge refers to the practical or theoretical understanding of a subject. It is information acquired by a person through experience or education. Technical competencies describe the skill-based application of the needed knowledge to perform the specific job and/or group of jobs efficiently and effectively, day to day, within an organization.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
